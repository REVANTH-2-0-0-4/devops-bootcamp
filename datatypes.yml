#  primitive data types
# string data type -- there are theree ways to represent strings in yaml
name : "Revanth"  # double quotes
city : 'Bangalore' # single quotes
country : India    # without quotes
#  for example if we want to write multi line strings we can use the following two methods

bio: Hi my name is reavanth kurapati 
i am an aspiring devops engineer

#  the above stuff will give error because of the new line in between the yaml parser dont know that .
#  to avoid that we can use the pipe(|) or greater than(>) symbols
description1 : |
  This is a multi line string.
  It preserves new lines.
  Useful for writing paragraphs.

 #the above ones will be preserved as it is with new lines
description2 : >
  This is a multi line string.
  It folds new lines into spaces.
  Useful for long sentences.
 # the above ones will be converted into a single line string by replacing new lines with spaces.
