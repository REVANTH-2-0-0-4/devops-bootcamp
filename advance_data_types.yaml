#  real world example : lets say there is a school and in school there is name field,principal filed,students field lets say we want to represent this in yaml

school : 
  name : Narayana Ramalingapuram school
  principal : 
    name : Dr.Ravi kumar
    age : 50
    experience : 25 years
    students : 
     - name : ajay
       age : 14
       grade : 9th
     - name : revanth
       age : 15
       grade : 10th
     - name : gana
       age : 14
       grade : 9th

#  the equivalent json representation of the above yaml is 
{
  "school": {
    "name": "Narayana Ramalingapuram school",
